#######Weight Measurement with HX711 and Raspberry Pi
This Python script interfaces with an HX711 load cell amplifier to measure weight using a load cell and a Raspberry Pi. The code captures the raw data from the HX711 and converts it to a meaningful weight value (in grams) by calibrating the scale with a known weight. The script continuously reads and prints the weight on the scale until it is interrupted.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that the following requirements are met:

Raspberry Pi: Any model with GPIO pins (tested on Raspberry Pi 3/4).
HX711 Load Cell Amplifier: Used to read the output from the load cell.
Load Cell: The sensor used to measure weight.
Python Libraries: The script requires the following libraries:
RPi.GPIO: For interacting with the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO pins.
hx711: The HX711 library for communicating with the HX711 load cell amplifier.
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install RPi.GPIO hx711
Wiring Diagram
The HX711 is connected to the Raspberry Pi via the GPIO pins:

DOUT: Pin 21 (GPIO21)
PD_SCK: Pin 20 (GPIO20)
Make sure the load cell is connected to the HX711 amplifier module
