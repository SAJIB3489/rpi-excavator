### Raspberry Pi5 -Powered Excavator


Excavator Control System
This repository contains the software and hardware implementation for controlling an RC excavator using a Raspberry Pi 5. The project includes a pressure sensor system for load detection and a lighting control system, ensuring efficient and safe operation.



The Excavator Control System enables wireless operation and monitoring of an RC excavator. Using a pressure sensor, we can measure the load on the boom and enforce a safety threshold for lifting heavy objects. The lighting system ensures visibility during operation and enhances the aesthetic appeal of the excavator.
